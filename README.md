# 🚀 ExpenseFlow
**An intelligent expense management system with dynamic approval workflows.**

## ✨ Key Features
💡 **Dynamic Approval Workflows** – Admins can visually build multi-level approval chains.

⚙️ **Conditional Logic Engine** – Supports hybrid approval rules.

📊 **Role-Based Dashboards** – Provides a tailored view for Employees, Managers, and Admins.

🧠 **AI-Powered OCR** – Instantly scan and digitize receipts with OCR.


## 💡 Inspiration
Built for the Odoo x Amalthea Hackathon 2025, ExpenseFlow tackles the challenge of rigid and slow expense approvals. We focused on creating a smart, flexible system with a dynamic, conditional approval engine to bring speed and transparency to a universal business problem.


## 🧩 How It Works

1.  **User Input:** A user submits an expense by either filling out the form or by simply scanning a receipt.

2.  **Processing:** The system uses OCR to parse receipt data, applies the company's custom rules, and automatically routes the claim to the correct approver.

3.  **Output:** The claim appears in the designated approver's queue. The Employee can track the final Approved/Rejected status in real-time on their dashboard as it moves through the workflow.
